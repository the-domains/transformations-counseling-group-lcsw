#### **What makes Transformations Counseling Group Different?**

Harriette and Ken our directors handpicked a team of therapists that offer a diversity of counseling / therapy sub-specialties and who, after working together over the past few years, now consider one another family. We meet together on a bi weekly basis to discuss the latest research and techniques so that we can provide you with the best possible care. Together we review cases and receive input from one another so that you get the benefit from not one but five other therapists. We coordinate your care with all your providers;  meaning if necessary we speak to your physician, psychiatrist, nurse practitioner, acupuncturist or other complimentary healers. Additionally for clients who are younger or with adults with severe anxiety and depression, you can request Butch, our certified support dog to help provide you with a  safe and caring animal helper.

**Transformation** is a universal constant that affects our lives from the moment we are born until we die. At the root of all growth, we find change. Occasionally, change and circumstances leading up to it are a source of extraordinary joy, but other times it brings feelings of discomfort, fear, or pain. Many changes are unavoidable and it's our response to those circumstances that will dictate the nature of our experiences. At the heart of every transformation, no matter how chaotic, there is substance. When we no longer resist change and instead regard it as an opportunity to grow, we find that we are far from helpless in the face of it.

Before we can truly internalize the power to master our destinies, we must accept that we cannot hide from changes. Transformation will take place whether or not we want it to. It is up to us to decide whether we will face it with open eyes or close ourselves off from opportunities hiding behind obstacles.

To make change work for you, look constructively at your situation and the feelings, thoughts and behaviors associated with it. Then ask yourself how you can benefit from the transformation that is, will and has taken place. As threatening as change can seem, it is often a sign that a new era of your life has begun. If you reevaluate your plans and goals in the days or weeks following a major change, you will discover that you can adapt your ambition to the circumstances before you and even capitalize on these changes. Optimism, enthusiasm, and flexibility will aid you greatly here, as there is nothing to be gained by dwelling on what might have been. Change can hurt in the short term but, if you are willing to embrace it proactively, its lasting impact will nearly always be emotionally physically and intellectually transformative.

Sometimes it is hard to go through change alone. Sometimes it is important to reach out to those that understand and do not pass judgment. At Transformations Counseling Group we have caring, compassionate and skilled professionals to help you go through one of life's transitions. At Transformations we believe that change is always an opportunity for growth.
